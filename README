OpenKeyval
==========

Setting it up
-------------
- Make sure you're serving the openkeyval directory from the root of your server.
- Your server supports .htaccess and is following the RewriteRules
- Invent your own salt to use when hashing values and put it into a file called salt.txt, in the same directory as the source code.
